# Udacity-DSND
This repository includes all the projects I have realized as part of Udacity Data scientist's Nanodegree


## Supervised Learning
Learn to build supervised machine learning models to make data-informed decisions. Learn to evaluate and validate the quality of your models.

### Project: Find Donors for CharityML with Kaggle
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization that provides financial support for people learning machine learning. In an effort to improve donor outreach effectiveness, youâ€™ll build an algorithm that best identifies potential donors. Your goal will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield.


## Deep Learning
Gain a solid foundation in neural networks, deep learning, and PyTorch.

### Project: Create an Image Classifier
In this project, you will implement an image classification application using a a deep learning model on a dataset of images. You will then use the trained model to classify new images. First you will develop your code in a Jupyter notebook, then convert it into a python application that you will run from the command line of your system.


## Unsupervised Learning
Learn to build unsupervised machine learning models, and use essential data processing techniques like scaling and PCA.

### Project: Creating Customer Segments with Arvato
The data and design for this project was provided by Arvato Financial Services. You will apply unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. You will preprocess the data, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, and implement clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company.
